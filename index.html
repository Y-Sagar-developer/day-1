      Prabhas made his acting debut with the drama Eeswar (2002), and later
      attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004). He went
      on to star in other commercially successful films such as Chatrapathi
      (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect
      (2011), and Mirchi (2013), winning the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his
      performance in the lattermost.[12][13] He went on to play a dual role in
